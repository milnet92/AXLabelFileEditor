# LabelFileEditor
A simple and easy-to-use tool to *kinda* replace the standard F&O Label Editor in Visual Studio.

# How to use
Just open your solution label file with this tool:

1. Select **Open With** in your solution label file

## Compare languages
You can compare the current label file against other languages, visualizing what is changed, added or removed. You can also **merge** the changes by either taking from one language or the other; individually or at bulk (*tell me you never had discrepances between label files...*)
